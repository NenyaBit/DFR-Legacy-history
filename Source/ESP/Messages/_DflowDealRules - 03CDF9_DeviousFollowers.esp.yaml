    We can make a new deal, or we can upgrade an existing deal.

    If you agree, I'll forget <Global=_DflowDealBaseDebtl> debt, but if you refuse, I'll add half of that as debt.

    In <Global=_DflowDealBaseDays> days you can buy out of the deal for <Global=_DflowDealBasePrice> times the level of the deal.

    You can buy out early, if you want to spoil the fun, but it costs extra.

    Also, if you upgrade the deal with time left on it, I'll add those days to the upgrade.
