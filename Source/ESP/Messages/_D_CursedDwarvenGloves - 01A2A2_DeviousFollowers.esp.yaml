    A warm pulse comes from the gauntlets you donned, and everything you're wearing disappears.

    Something tightens around your wrists inside the gauntlets, and they force your fingers to curl into fists.

    An invisible force pulls your hands closer together until they reach a fixed distance.

    No matter how you try you cannot force your wrists further apart, or closer together.

    What strange dwemer curse is this?
