  Value: >-
    After each rest <Alias.ShortName=_DMaster> will set a value between %.0f and %.0f every day.

    Then decide if you have the option to leave or not.

    Every time you change area, they correct your gold if it differs from this value, adjusting your debt and credit.

    To make this fun for <Alias.ShortName=_DMaster> the only time they will tell you your debt is after sleeping.

    You can ask to carry more gold, and if agreed, that will be the new amount until you rest.

    The amount you can carry may be reduced by 20%% on debt update, follower bleedout, or device removal.
